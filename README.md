Ada Lovelace Tribute website: Project Description

This project started as a landing page I built earlier with HTML and CSS as part of The Odin Project curriculum. I now use this page as a base layout for a tribute page about Ada Lovelace. The structure is built with semantic HTML, styled with flexbox and custom CSS. Recently, the project has been converted to PHP for server-side rendering, modularity, and better maintainability. The goal is to practice structuring and designing web content while also using design to tell a story, now incorporating PHP for dynamic content inclusion.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Semantic HTML structure
- Flexbox layout techniques
- Custom CSS styling
- Consistent and maintainable class naming
- Use of external fonts
- Version control with GitHub commits
- PHP basics (includes, server-side rendering)
- Modular PHP architecture with partials
- Basic routing with separate PHP files for each page

Ada Lovelace Tribute website: Project Description

This project started as a landing page I built earlier with HTML and CSS as part of The Odin Project curriculum. I now use this page as a base layout for a tribute page about Ada Lovelace. The structure is built with semantic HTML, styled with flexbox and custom CSS. The goal is to practice structuring and designing web content while also using design to tell a story.

Skills Demonstrated

- Semantic HTML structure
- Flexbox layout techniques
- Custom CSS styling
- Consistent and maintainable class naming
- Use of external fonts
- Version control with GitHub commits
